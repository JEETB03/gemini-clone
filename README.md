# Gemini AI Clone

**Gemini** is a web application that emulates the functionality of Google Gemini AI. It allows users to interact with a chatbot, ask various questions, and receive answers dynamically generated by an AI model. This project demonstrates the integration of AI into a user-friendly React-based web application.

## Features

- **Dynamic Chat Interface:** Users can ask questions through a chat interface, and the AI will respond with answers.
- **AI Model Integration:** Uses the Google Gemini AI model to generate responses.
- **Interactive UI:** A responsive and interactive user interface with a sidebar, main content area, and input fields.
- **Previous Prompt History:** Users can view and select from previous prompts.
- **Safety Warning:** Includes warnings to users about the potential for inaccurate information from the AI.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend:** React.js, CSS
- **Backend:** None (Client-side API calls)
- **AI Model:** Google Gemini AI (via API)
- **Build Tool:** Vite

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

```

├── src/
│   ├── assets/
│   │   └── assets/

│   ├── App.jsx
│   ├── index.css
│   └── main.jsx
├── .gitignore
├── index.html
├── package.json
└── README.md
```

### Key Files:
- **`Main.jsx`**: Contains the main content area and the chat interface.
- **`Sidebar.jsx`**: Contains the sidebar with options and recent prompts.
- **`Context.jsx`**: Manages the global state and handles API calls.
- **`gemini.js`**: Configures the Google Gemini AI model and handles communication with the AI.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (v14.x or later)
- **npm** or **yarn**
- A **Google Cloud account** with access to the Google Gemini AI API.

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/gemini-ai-clone.git
   cd gemini-ai-clone
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```

3. **Set up the API key:**
   - Replace the `apiKey` in `gemini.js` with your Google Gemini AI API key.

### Running the Project

1. **Start the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # or
   yarn dev
   ```

2. **Open your browser** and go to the localhost address displayed in the terminal (example --> `http://localhost:5173`) to see the application in action.

## How It Works

- **Context API**: Manages global state across components, including input data, recent prompts, and the AI response.
- **Google Gemini AI Integration**: The AI model is accessed via an API key. Prompts are sent to the model, and responses are dynamically rendered in the UI.
- **Responsive UI**: The application features a responsive design, adapting to different screen sizes.

### Main Flow:
1. **User Input**: The user types a prompt in the input box.
2. **API Call**: The input is sent to the Google Gemini AI model via an API call.
3. **Response Handling**: The response is processed and displayed in the main content area, with certain text styled in bold as needed.

## Customization

- **Styling**: Modify the `*.css` files to change the appearance of the application.
- **AI Model Configuration**: The AI model's behavior (e.g., temperature, topP) can be adjusted in `gemini.js`.
- **Additional Features**: Extend the app by adding more interactive elements, such as custom commands or enhanced history management.

## Future Improvements

- **Persistent Prompt History**: Implement a feature to save and load prompt history between sessions.
- **Enhanced Safety Settings**: Further refine the AI’s safety settings to better control the output.
- **User Authentication**: Add user accounts to manage personalized prompt histories and settings.
